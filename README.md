# Employee Management System

## Overview
This repository contains a **Java-based Employee Management System** implemented with a Text User Interface (TUI). The program allows users to perform key operations like adding, removing, updating, and viewing employee details, all while demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Features
1. **Add Employee**: Add a new employee to the system with relevant details.
2. **Remove Employee**: Remove an existing employee from the system by their unique ID.
3. **Update Employee**: Update the details of an existing employee.
4. **View Employee Details**: Display details of all employees or a specific employee.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation**: All employee-related data is securely stored and managed within the `Employee` class.
- **Abstraction**: High-level methods provide an interface for managing employee records.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Extendable design for possible future enhancements, like adding different types of employees.

## How to Run
1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac EmployeeManagementSystem.java
